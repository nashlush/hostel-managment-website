This project was build by Myself Avinash Jha, in coordination with my friend Sejal Agarwal.
This project is an Advanced java project which basically deals with managing a hostel.
It contains two portals viz a student portal and a warden portal. Both of these portals contains different
functionalities in accordance to each other.

This website basically works on the idea similar to creating a google classroom (if you've used it).
It uses a unique id to function and to bind the students and the warden collectively into a hostel.
Every hostel has its own unique id.
